#### _Three Stage Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This is a project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer and Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree Schoolarships and has only learning purpose.

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project **Stage One**, students will take a static webpage design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Students also have to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### Specification

The provided code is for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Student's job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### How to run the app

1. Clone or download the repository

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` . For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8080`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080`, and look around. Once you've visited a page (the home page or one of the restaurants page) you should be able to revisit it even if you are offline

4. To enjoy the offline experience you have to check the Offline Box In Chrome DevTools -> Application -> Service Workers.
